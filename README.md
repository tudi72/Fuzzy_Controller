# Fuzzy_Controller
Constructing a fuzzy controller for a set of  given rules. The rules are minimized to see the difference in ouput values.
The quality criterion for minimization is the time control. 
The project has its main focus on checking the evolution of rule minimization in the output graph. 
In the first picture we analyze the system if we took an intuitive approach for rule minimmization.

The second approach has a more sturdy and concise base. We apply a Karnaugh Map for minimization and the resulting graph will be :
